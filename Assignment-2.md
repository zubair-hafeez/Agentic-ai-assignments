This assignment is designed to familiarize you with foundational concepts in APIs, SDKs, and LLM-related terminology, enabling you to apply this knowledge effectively in software development.

Write a short note (not exceeding 2 lines) on the following topics:
-API  
-SDK  
-Web APIs  
-Library APIs  
-Prompting and Completion 





### API  
An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another, enabling data exchange or functionality access.  

### SDK  
An **SDK (Software Development Kit)** is a collection of tools, libraries, and documentation provided by a platform to help developers build applications for that platform.  

### Web APIs  
**Web APIs** are APIs that use HTTP protocols to allow interaction with web-based services, often enabling data retrieval or manipulation over the internet.  

### Library APIs  
**Library APIs** are interfaces provided by programming libraries that offer prebuilt functionality, allowing developers to integrate features without writing code from scratch.  

### Prompting and Completion  
**Prompting and Completion** involve sending an input (prompt) to a language model to generate a contextually relevant output (completion) based on the given data or instructions.
